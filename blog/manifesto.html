We are uncovering better ways to develop software by valuing the needs of our stakeholders, developers, and humans over machines, and by embracing reality instead of idealized assumptions.

Because of our values, we have come to choose:
1. Human over machine
2. Pragmatism over dogmatism
3. Simplicity over complexity
4. Clarity over cleverness
5. Working smart over working hard

Human over machine

The needs of the human outweigh the needs of the machine. Write code for human consumption, not machine optimization. Only optimize when it meaningfully improves human experience.

Pragmatism over dogmatism

We do not blindly follow software dogma. We understand its benefits and decide if it is right for us. We evaluate principles on their merits and context, not on reputation or popularity.

Simplicity over complexity

Choose simple over complex, complex over complicated. We love simplicity and avoid complexity. We choose simplicity first. When complexity is necessary, we admire sophistication — but never tolerate unnecessary complication.

Clarity over cleverness

We value code that is easy to read and maintain over code that is clever but obscure. Under pressure, cleverness leads to regret.
                
Working smart over working hard

We must empower our people to work smart first before requiring them to work hard. Laziness is only a liability if it is detrimental to productivity. Otherwise, it leads to automation and innovation. Working hard is noble — but working smart makes it sustainable.

We create code for the betterment of our world.
You can do whatever you want, and believe whatever you like — but it means little if it doesn't resonate with people.
Tools change like the seasons. Trends fade like youth.
Flash gains attention, but fundamentals build dynasties.
It is values that keep us building what matters.</div>
